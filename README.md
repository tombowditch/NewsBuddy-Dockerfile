# NewsBuddy-Dockerfile

Needed a quick Dockerfile to launch newsbuddy quickly, this is awful. I'll improve it later.

You'll need to edit boot.sh and change `tombowditch` to your nickname, you'll also probably want to change `--concurrent`.

Grabbed the base from [the warrior Dockerfile](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/warrior-dockerfile/blob/master/Dockerfile)
